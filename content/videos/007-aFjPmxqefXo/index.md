title: Ask Me Anything
---

In this interactive series we're going to explain and demystify Angular Core Concepts through practical live-coding and deep dive into understanding theory.

In this session, we will do an AMA (ask me anything) in angular, a session where you can ask anything about angular in Darija and we will try to answer you.

At the end of our session, we will do a contest on Kahoot and the winner will have a 1-year subscription on thinkster.io pro plan.

Pannel members:
- Elfouih ilyass
- Chihab otmani
- Abderrahim Soubai Elidrissi

Special thanks to our sponsor thinkster.io
