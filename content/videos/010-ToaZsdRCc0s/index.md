title: Community App #1 -  Angular in Darija
---

In this interactive series we're going to explain and demystify Angular Core Concepts through practical live-coding and deep dive into understanding theory.

In this session, we will continue on building a real-world community application.

Your contributions are welcome here https://github.com/ngMorocco/ngx-darija.

We will pick and answer attendees' questions on the fly.
