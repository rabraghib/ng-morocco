Salam 👏

In this interactive series we're going to explain and demystify Angular Core Concepts through practical live-coding and deep dive into understanding theory.

In this session, we will continue on building and reviewing contributions from community on our official Angular In Darija application.

Join the official ngMorocco Community on Discord! 👉 https://bit.ly/ngDiscord

Your contributions are welcome here https://github.com/ngMorocco/ngx-darija.

We will pick and answer attendees' questions on the fly.

Everything in Darija 🇲🇦

Special thanks to our sponsor thinkster.io
